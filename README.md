Then goes on to let you choose and upload your profile picture. This is a file input that will be stored in the server locally, in a folder called uploads, for simplicity. You can edit your contact information as well. <br />

Uploading projects was implemented next, where a modal pops up to configure the projects info and media. Then, the page updates and your projects can be seen. <br />

I added 4 types of proyects: picture, video, animation (on loop) and audio. A profile ends up like this. <br />
